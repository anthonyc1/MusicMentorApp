	<center>Who we are</center>
	<p>This project was created by a Computer Science major who also has a passion for piano and music.</p>
	<center>Inspiration</center>
	<p>The inspiration for this project started when I took an intro to music theory course at my university. While I knew some music theory prior to the class, I was exposed to the subject at a more comprehensive level such as learning the various types of minor scales, how to build a chord from a key, and how to determine an interval from a root. Much of what of I learned will be found in this project, but formatted in an easy-to-read and crash-course style. I want to help others with an interest in music or learning how to play an instrument to learn music theory with this free online resource. Also this project was a way for me to combine my passions for computer science and music, which was very rewarding for me!</p>
	<center>Next steps</center>
	<p>I plan to finish developing this project and then send it to production stage, where hopefully interested users will find this as a useful fun tool for learning music theory. I'm open to any feedback, suggestions or constructive criticism, regarding my project because my end goal is to improve this project for you, the users! Feel free to contact me via our Facebook page.</p>
